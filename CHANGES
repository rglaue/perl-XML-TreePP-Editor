Revision history for XML-TreePP-Editor

0.11    2009-11-04 reg
        - Added test cases to test all primary functions
        - Fixed an issue with modify-delete action when deleting multiple
          nodes, in which it deleted the first node first and caused an issue
          since this changed the positions on all remaining nodes and there
          was more nodes scheduled to be deleted.
          The fix was to delete the last node first, or LIFO instead of FIFO.
